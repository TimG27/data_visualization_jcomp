## Introduction

This project is the culmination of the Data Visualization course, demonstrating the application of concepts such as exploratory data analysis, chart creation, and interactive visualization. The code is structured to guide you through the process of transforming raw data into meaningful and informative visualizations.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilize various statistical and visual techniques to understand the structure and patterns within the dataset.
- **Chart Creation:** Implement a variety of charts, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more, to represent different aspects of the data.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Incorporate interactive elements using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to enhance user engagement and exploration.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Learn best practices for cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for visualization.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization-course-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd data-visualization-course-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.
2. Follow the code cells or sections labeled for specific tasks (EDA, chart creation, etc.).
3. Execute the cells or run the script to generate visualizations.

Feel free to experiment with the code and modify it to suit your own datasets or exploration goals.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Other relevant libraries as needed

Ensure these libraries are installed before running the code.
